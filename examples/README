This directory contains example input for SYMPLER.

Check the specific READMEs for individual input files.

Note that there are further examples in the testsuite directory.

Note that in contrast to the testsuite directory the examples in this directory 
might require minor changes to be compatible with the newest version of SYMPLER. 
In such a case, a first run with SYMPLER usually produces error messages that 
help fixing the problem. 

Feel free to contribute updated versions of the input files or new examples to 
the code-repository at https://github.com/kauzlari/sympler
